This website is under development.

I am a final year MSci Physics student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/ "ICL"), looking to continue my studies with a PhD in High Energy Physics. 

My master's thesis on the identification of hadronic tau lepton decays with domain adaptation using adversarial machine learning techniques at CMS is available online: [CERN-THESIS-2022-126](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2827366/ "Thesis").

Here, you can find links to my [GitHub](https://lucasrussell01.github.io "github") account (with code from several past projects) and my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasrussell01/ "linkedin") here, as well as my [email](mailto:lucas.russell19@imperial.ac.uk "mail") address if you'd like to get in touch. 

In the future, this website will include descriptions of some of my previous work on the [Compact Muon Solenoid](https://cms.cern/ "CMS") (CMS) experiment at CERN, which I worked on during my MSci project on hadronic tau identification, and during a summer project on neutral pion reconstruction for a study of the CP nature of the Higgs boson. I will also include a summary of a previous plasma physics project on the [Joint European Torus](https://www.euro-fusion.org/devices/jet/ "JET") (JET).
