This website is under development.

I am a third year MSci Physics student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/ "ICL"), with a particular interest in High Energy Physics. This website includes examples of some of my previous work on the [Compact Muon Solenoid](https://cms.cern/ "CMS") (CMS) experiment at CERN, which I worked on for my MSci project on hadronic tau identification, and summer project on neutral pion reconstruction for a study of the CP nature of the Higgs boson. I have also included a summary of a plasma physics project on the [Joint European Torus](https://www.euro-fusion.org/devices/jet/ "JET") (JET).
