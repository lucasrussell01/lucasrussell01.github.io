I'm an incoming PhD student in elementary particle physics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/high-energy-physics/ "ICL"), supported
 by the Schr&ouml;dinger Scholarship.
I'll be working on an analysis of the CP structure of the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and Tau leptons on the 
[Compact Muon Solenoid](https://cms.cern/ "CMS") experiment at CERN.


My master's thesis on the identification of hadronic tau lepton decays with domain adaptation using adversarial machine learning techniques at CMS is available online
 [CERN-THESIS-2022-126](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2827366/ "Thesis").

Here, you can find links to my [GitHub](https://github.com/lucasrussell01 "github") account (with code from several past projects) and my 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasrussell01/ "linkedin") and [INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2686809 'inspire') profiles, 
as well as my [email](mailto:lucas.russell@cern.ch "mail") address if you'd like to get in touch. 

In the future, this website will include descriptions of some of my work on CMS,
primarily focused on studies of the Higgs boson decaying into tau leptons, and
machine learning based tau reconstruction/identification.
