I am a final year MSci Physics student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/ "ICL"),
passionate about High Energy Physics and the application of Machine Learning techniques at the energy frontier, 
 intending to continue my studies with a PhD in the area from October 2023. 

My master's thesis on the identification of hadronic tau lepton decays with domain adaptation using adversarial machine learning techniques at CMS is available online
 [CERN-THESIS-2022-126](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2827366/ "Thesis").

Here, you can find links to my [GitHub](https://github.com/lucasrussell01 "github") account (with code from several past projects) and my 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasrussell01/ "linkedin") and [INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2686809 'inspire') profiles, 
as well as my [email](mailto:lucas.russell@cern.ch "mail") address if you'd like to get in touch. 

In the future, this website will include descriptions of some of my work on the [Compact Muon Solenoid](https://cms.cern/ "CMS") (CMS) experiment at CERN,
primarily focused on studies of the Higgs boson decaying into tau leptons and tau identification/reconstruction.
