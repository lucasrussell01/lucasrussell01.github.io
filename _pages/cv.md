This is a brief summary of my education and research experiences, for further information please contact me via [email](mailto:lucas.russell@cern.ch "mail"). 

## Education
* **Imperial College London, MSci Physics with a Year Abroad** (2019-2023)
  * First Class Honours (79.47% overall)
  * Master's Thesis:  Identification of Hadronic Tau Lepton Decays with Domain Adaptation using Adversarial Machine Learning Techniques at CMS (awarded 90%).
  * Year abroad at Ecole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne, Switzerland.
  * Awards: Dean's List (Year 3), Ken Allen Prize for Academic Excellence (2022).

* **Lyc&eacute;e Francais Charles de Gaulle, French Baccalaureate** (2012-2019)
  * Scientific stream, specialisation in Mathematics, Highest honors (Mention Tr&egrave;s Bien).
  * Overall grade of 20.11/20 (exceeding maximum grade through optional subjects).

## Research Skills
* **Programming**: Python, C++ (including ROOT), Linux (Bash/Zsh), Latex.
* **Machine Learning**: Deep Neural Networks (Dense, Convolutional and Pooling Layers) for classification and regression. Experienced with TensorFlow/Keras packages.
* **Other**: Communication of results (e.g. presentations), teamwork, problem solving, and collaborative coding/version control (Git, GitHub).

## Research Experience
* **High Energy Physics Group, Imperial College London** (Summer 2022)
  * Summer Project on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment.
  * Improved the reconstruction of neutral pions in hadronic tau lepton decays for an analysis of the CP structure of the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and taus.
   
* **High Energy Physics Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne** (2021-2022)
  * Master's Project during Year Abroad on the CMS Experiment.
  * Contributed to the development of the deep convolutional neural network used for tau identification at CMS, ”DeepTau”, which simultaneously discriminates tau leptons decaying into hadrons against quark/gluon jets, electrons and muons. 
  * Made significant changes to the network architecture to introduce domain adaptation by backpropagation into the training workflow using C++/ROOT and Python, to reduce the impact of mismodelling in the simulated events used for training.


* **Plasma Physics Group, Imperial College London** (Summer 2021)
  * Summer Project on the Joint European Torus (JET) Experiment.
  * Determined an analytical solution to the convolution integral of a modified Lorentzian and a Gaussian, to combine the effects of several broadening mechanisms for spectral fitting.

## Teaching Experience 
* **Imperial College London, Undergraduate Teaching Assistant** (2022-2023)
  * Demonstrator on the Year 1 Practical Physics Course. 
  * Assisting first year undergraduates during computing (python) and data analysis sessions.
